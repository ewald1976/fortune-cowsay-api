Is that enough muddy thinking for one morning?

It seems like a sane thing to me, but that's a rather low standard.

: I hope I never have to design my own language. I would be schizophrenic
: before the day ends.
That's backwards.  You have to be schizophrenic before the day starts.

Hmm.  What would it mean to goto a class?

In any event (no pun intended), I've always wondered how it is you
can "kill" a process with a SIGCONT.  As long as we're fixing everything
else, maybe we can fix Unix too.  :-)

Or I suppose we could always recontextualize the meaning of "is"
instead.  There is prior art...

Dude, nowadays we're trying to make Perl 6 more Unicode aware, not
less; /usr/share/dict/words is so, like, monocultural, and stuff.

It might do what you mean.  Personally, I would never mean that if I
could help it.  :-)

But I'm sure some will argue that's too subtle.  (Hi, @Larry<Damian>.)

We're still discussing it on @Larry, but I think we can make that work.

Yes, it's a slippery slope.  No, we are not sliding all the way down
it.  And it's just as easy to slide up this slope as well as down, and
end up with Lisp rather than APL.  Neither extreme is healthy.

Almost nothing in the design of Perl 6 is there for a single purpose.

The compiler is not immutable; it is a means to an end.
And the end I am imagining is one that I cannot imagine.

Of course, if we make the MMD rules sufficiently complicated, we'll just have
to make the warning spit out a spreadsheet to show the calculations.  Then we
hide all that behind an interview process, just like all our wonderful tax
preparation software...  -- Larry Wall in <20050708185704.GA12164@wall.org>
