been so great.

Numbers:

People talk smack about God and get punished, then people talk smack about

nice man in a wheat field, so it all works out.

1 Samuel:

The Philistines take the Ark of the Covenant, but it doesn’t work, so they send
it back. Saul becomes king and defeats them, but makes God mad. So, David takes
over as king, and you know he’s good because one time he killed a HUGE guy with
a rock.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
2 Samuel:

David kills a bunch of people, which is great, but then he sleeps with a
married woman, and WOW is God mad about that. On the plus side, they have a kid
named Solomon.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
1 Kings:

David is dying and his son Solomon takes over. David tells Solomon to be good
to God, which is a little insulting considering how Solomon was conceived.
Anyway, the kingdom splits in two even though Solomon built a nice temple and
everything.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
2 Kings:

The northern chunk of the kingdom gets conquered for being bad. The southern
chunk people feel pretty self-righteous about it, but then the same thing
happens to them.

The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
1 Chronicles:

Hold on, back up. Remember David from earlier? Really good king. Anyway, sorry
to interrupt. Continue.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
2 Chronicles:

The Northern kingdom crapped out and got conquered, so let’s focus on the
Southern Kingdom, which also crapped out and got conquered. Everyone moves to
Jerusalem, which seemed like a good idea at the time.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Ezra:

The Israelites spend 20 years building a temple, then celebrate by eating
crackers. Later, they decide some of their wives and children are a little too
pagan, so they pack them off and start looking for nice Jewish girls.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Nehemiah:

Nehemiah builds a wall around Jerusalem for cheap by getting each guy to make
some wall behind his house. Later, Jewish men start getting with pagans again.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Esther:

Esther marries the Persian king. Normally, this would be bad on the “no
marrying outside the faith” front, but it all works out when she can get a guy
hung for trying to kill all the Jews.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Job:

The devil bets God that Job is only faithful because his life is good. God
makes Job sick, ruins his farm, and kills his family. Later, Job is miffed, so

Song of Solomon:

Interlude: A sexy poem, with romantic talk, such as “Your teeth are like a
flock of uniformly shaped ewes.” No, wait WAIT. It’s not about sex, it’s about
loving God. Phew.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Isaiah:

Things are going right to Hell in Judea. Isaiah declares that Jerusalem will
not fall, but hedges his bets a little by not attaching a time stamp to that.
Similarly, he says that at some point the Messiah will come.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Jeremiah:

Jeremiah keeps saying Jerusalem will fall to the Babylonians. Eventually,
people get mad and throw him in a water tank, which tells you something about
the quality of sanitation back then. Later, Jerusalem falls to the Babylonians.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Lamentations:

Interlude: Some sad songs about how God was right to let the Babylonians siege,

Ezekiel:

God tells Ezekiel to tell the Israelites that it’s their fault Jerusalem got
destroyed, but he’ll get them a nicer town later, okay?

The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Daniel:

Daniel is touched by God with the gift of prophecy, which means he gets a

time he gets thrown in a furnace and the time he gets thrown in a lion pit, but
jobs were tougher back then.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Hosea:

God orders Hosea to marry an unfaithful harlot, so he does. She cheats on him.

relationship with God. Hey, whatever gets you through the night.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness

During a plague of locusts, Joel prophesies that the locusts are the army of

Obadiah:

Edom is ruled as a vassal state of Israel for many years. Later, when the

Jonah:

Jonah doesn’t want to be a prophet, so God has him eaten by a whale. At this
point, Jonah changes his mind and God has the whale puke him up. Jonah

prophesies doom for the faithless.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Haggai:

Haggai prophesies that everyone better hurry up and build the temple, or bad
stuff will happen in Israel. Change that “or” to “and,” and he was 100%
correct.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Zechariah:

Fast forward a few years. Israel got conquered, then unconquered. Zechariah
tells people to clean up the place so a Messiah can come by. The Messiah will
apparently come riding on a donkey, so, they probably don’t need to clean too
hard.
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Malachi:

Malachi decries the Israelites for horrible practices, such as sacrificing
animals that are not top quality. He prophesies that the Messiah will be

John:

Not only are those other three gospels ALL TRUE, but Jesus did so much awesome
stuff, John doesn’t even have time to list it. Amen!
%
The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness
Acts:

Finding the market for Jewish converts to be quite limited, the apostles branch
out to gentiles. In the process, Steve gets killed, but it’s okay because it
gets Paul to convert. Paul does a great job, until the Romans get mad.

Romans:

Dear Romans,

Hey, it’s me Paul. Taking a trip to Spain, but I’m planning to drop by. Make

coming of God’s Kingdom, you are still eligible to enter. With this in mind,
anyone caught mourning shall be considered lacking in faith.

Dear Titus,

The main thing with picking leaders for your church is that they’re not stupid

Dear Everyone,

GUYS. I was on the Island of Patmos, when (WHOA!) an Angel started talking.
Then the Angel said, “Write all this down!” And he said God’s gonna play some

big bowls of plague on Earth and kill a bunch more. Then hail and dragons and
so forth, BUT THEN we get a new Jerusalem and sin is abolished. Should be any
minute now.
