"When we speak of prayer or of the results of prayer we always imply only one kind of prayer — petition or we think that petition can be united with all other kinds of prayers.… Most prayers have nothing in common with petitions. I speak of ancient prayers; many of them are much older than Christianity. These prayers are, so to speak, recapitulations; by repeating them aloud or to himself a man endeavors to experience what is in them, their whole content, with his mind and his feeling."

"Objective knowledge, the idea of unity included, belongs to objective consciousness. The forms which express this knowledge when perceived by subjective consciousness are inevitably distorted and, instead of truth, they create more and more delusions. With objective consciousness it is possible to see and feel the unity of everything. But for subjective consciousness the world is split up into millions of separate and unconnected phenomena. Attempts to connect these phenomena into some sort of system in a scientific or philosophical way lead to nothing because man cannot reconstruct the idea of the whole starting from separate facts and they cannot divine the principles of the division of the whole without knowing the laws upon which this division is based."

"The advantage of the separate individual is that he is very small and that, in the economy of Nature, it makes no difference whether there is one mechanical man more or less. We can easily understand this correlation of magnitudes if we imagine the correlation between a microscopic cell and our own body. The presence or absence of one cell will change nothing in the life of the body. We cannot be conscious of it, and it can have no influence on the life and functions of the organism. In exactly the same way a separate individual is too small to influence the life of the cosmic organism to which he stands in the same relation (with regard to size) as a cell stands to our own organism. And this is precisely what makes his 'evolution' possible; on this are based his 'possibilities'."

These are the first words of truth — not truth in quotation marks but truth in the real meaning of the word; truth which is not merely theoretical, not simply a word, but truth that can be realized in practice.

This liberation can indeed be very great. All men desire it and strive after it. But it cannot be attained without the first liberation, a lesser liberation. The great liberation is liberation from influences outside us. The lesser liberation is liberation from influences within us."

One twentieth of all our energy goes to emotional and instinctive centres.  Self-remembering is a lamp which must be kept alight by energy from these two centres.  Our thinking centre is not really a centre, but an apparatus for collecting impressions.

Formatory apparatus resembles a hired typist who works for a firm and has a large number of stereotyped replies for external impressions.  She sends printed replies to other centres who are the ‘directors’ of the firm and who are strangers to each other.  Wrong replies are often sent, as the typist is asleep or lazy.

In deep sleep all communication between centres is closed.  Our sleep is bad because we do not cut off lines of communication.

We have good and bad angels.  The good angels work by way of our voluntary, active nature and the bad through our passive nature.

Mr. Self-love and Madame Vanity are the two chief agents of the devil.

Do not be affected by externals.  In themselves they are harmless; it is we who allow ourselves to be hurt by them.

If we do what we like doing, we are immediately rewarded by the pleasure of doing it.  If we do what we don’t like doing the reward must come later.  It is a mathematical law and all life is mathematics.

Man is a symbol of the laws of creation; in him there is evolution, involution, struggle, progress and retrogression, struggle between positive and negative, active and passive, yes and no, good and evil.

Men have their minds and women their feelings more highly developed.  Either alone can give nothing.  Think what you feel and feel what you think.  Fusion of the two produces another force.

For some people religion is useful but for others it is only a policeman.

We are sheep kept to provide wool for our masters who feed us and keep us as slaves of illusion.  But we have a chance of escape and our masters are anxious to help us, but we like being sheep.  It is comfortable.

Sincerity is the key to self-knowledge and to be sincere with oneself brings great suffering.

Free will is the function of the Master within us.  Our ‘will’ is the supremacy of one desire over another.

Eastern art has a mathematical basis.  It is a script with an inner and an outer content.  In Persia there is a room in a monastery which makes one weep owing to mathematical combinations of different parts of its architecture.  Real art is knowledge and not talent.

An ordinary man has no ‘Master.’  He is ruled now by the mind, now by the feelings and now by the body.  Often the order comes from the automatic apparatus and still more often he is ordered about by the sex centre.  Real will can only be when one ‘I’ rules, when there is a ‘master’ in the house.

Morality is a stick with two ends; it can be turned this way and that.
― George Gurdjieff

From the time when man began to live on the Earth, from the time of Adam onwards, there started to be formed within him, with the help of God, of Nature, and of all his surroundings, an organ whose function is conscience.  Every man has this organ, and whoever is guided by it automatically lives according to God’s commandments.  If our consciences were clear, and not buried, there would be no need to speak about morality, for consciously or unconsciously everyone would behave according to God’s commandments.  Unfortunately conscience is covered up with a kind of crust which can be pierced only by intense suffering; then conscience speaks.  But after a while a man calms down and once more the organ becomes covered over and buried.

You should forget about morality.  Conversations about morality are simply empty talk.  Your aim is inner morality.

External morality is different everywhere.

You should understand, and establish it as a firm rule, not to pay attention to other people’s opinions.  You must be free of people surrounding you, and when you are free inside you will be free of them.

To be just at the moment of action is a hundred times more valuable than to be just afterwards.

To gain anything real, long practice is necessary.  Try to accomplish very small things first.

There are two kinds of doing—automatic and doing what you ‘wish.’  Take a small thing which you ‘wish’ to do and cannot do and make this your God.  Let nothing interfere.  If you ‘wish,’ you can.  Without wishing you never ‘can.’  ‘Wish’ is the most powerful thing in the world.

In the river of life suffering is not intentional.  In conscious life suffering is intentional and of great value.

To love one must first forget all about love.  Make it your aim and look for direction.  As we are we cannot possibly love.
